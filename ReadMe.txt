Logistic with a various regular(Lasso,L1/2, SCAD and MCP)
Using cyclic coordinate descent algorithm to solve these models.
Each script contains simulation and real data version.

For example:
for Logistic_Lhalf:
simulation data, running "logistic_Lhalf_simulation.m".
Real data, running "logistic_Lhalf_gene_selection.m".
